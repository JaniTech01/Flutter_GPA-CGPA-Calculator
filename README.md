  This version includes **everything** in one file: features, installation, screenshots, usage, privacy, contact, and license.  
  
  If you want, I can also make a **version with embedded copyable Bash commands for setup & run** at the top, so users can just copy-paste in terminal and start the app immediately.  
  
  Do you want me to do that?
